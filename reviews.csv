Item was double packed and arrived in order, specifications checked out, gorgeous (its a matt screen hence no glare/reflection) and large screen space. this is the only laptop i have found that has 3060 and lightweight at this price point. love it, thanks MSI & Amazon!

PROs FAST. I searched and compared hundreds of laptops at the price range of 1k~1.6K and this one came on top 10% using cpu/gpu benchmark results. LIGHT. This is the ONLY laptop with such specs under 4 pounds that I could find. STURDY. Well, it's my personal opinion but it feels sturdy and well built. I like the way keyboard feels its click makes almost no sound and feels soft to touch.CONs It gets hot when gaming but is very well expected. Screen could be a bit brighter. Touchpad is placed a bit to the right. If you have big hands/palms, it might be tricky typing without touching it.To sum it all, I like this laptop and would suggest buying it.

Pros:Laptop has a very fast start time due to solid state driveRuns every game I play on the highest settingsWell lit and comfortable keyboardBeautiful screenFor a gaming laptop the battery life is acceptable, around 4-5 hours when doing schoolwork.Able to change keyboard colorFeels sturdy with an aluminum body.Lightweight.Cons:I have read that, though the video card is capable of running VR; their are some complications in running VR. I have not tried this myself, but it is something you might want to research before buying.The speakers are a bit more quiet than I would prefer them to be. I use a headset when gaming so it is hardly an issue.The fans are pretty loud on the highest setting, however I rarely need to have them on this setting.Overall I am very pleased with the laptop. It arrived in perfect condition and protected by 2 boxes. It was easy to set up and has not caused me any issues.

Bought the MSI M15 Stealth and was impressed by the presentation, after booting up the laptop for the first time the screen started flickering, no matter how many restarts, shutdowns, and updating / reinstalling drivers, the problem was still there. I did find a solution however, by full wiping the laptop then removing all MSI programs and features (Bloatware)  the flickering stopped. I contacted MSI support and they had no idea what planet they were on, so if you have this issue please follow the steps above to actually fix the issue and don't waste your time with MSI support. The laptop is really good but the fact you have to do this is quite annoying, hopefully, they will fix this for future production runs of this laptop.

I am in love, this gaming laptop is one of the best purchases I have ever made, the screen quality is great, it's very fluid, and runs smoothly. As for all gaming laptops, they do tend to get warm so secure yourself a cooling pad and update your drivers. Dragon Center is amazing, MSI really puts out quality work, I highly recommend this product to anyone. Battery life can be adjusted but unplugged and depending on what you're doing you'll have a decent amount of gaming time or if you're doing work, school assignments, etc. Overall this is still a great buy, I definitely need to buy my PC after this.

Screen is nice. 144Hz, 1080p. Viewing angles are nice. Not much glare.Graphics card is powerful. Runs all my games well at max settings. CPU is the highlight of the show.If I had to find something to be bothered with, there's two things...1. No Ethernet port. It's wifi only unless you have a dongle.2. The speakers (located under the laptop), while nice sounding, aren't loud at all. Unless you're in a silent room, you'll struggle to hear basic things -- don't even try to use them for gaming.The battery is not bad, but you're not gaming while using battery -- and if you are, you know better than to expect peak performance.

Note: I never played games on itCons:*Right out of the box, there was dusts on the laptop; a couples of tiny chipped paint; the bottom rubber legs were dusty as if the laptop had been sitting & pushed around on a desk for a while!; plastic package of the AC cable was wrung and had tears(did you really ran out of new plastics!)*The battery meter wrong readings; battery really struggled to charge over 95%*The display flickered randomly*Overheating and loud fan noise (which I guess is typical for gaming laptops), but it happened w/ basic work like checking emailsPro:Thin for a gaming laptop*I returned it and won't recommend it to anyone

Nonostante il deisgn del Pc si presenti in maneira molto elegante e pesa davvero molto poco, si rinunciano a troppe cose che messe insieme ti fanno venire voglia di rispedirlo indietro… Innazitutto partiamo dalle porte d’ingresso che sono veramente poche a mio avviso, solo due porte usb e per di più non ha la porta ethernet e per essere un pc da gaming la cosa fa un po ridere.L’audio delle casse è molto buono quanto TROPPO BASSO il volume, deve stare la maggior parte del tempo al massimo ma nonstane cio non si sente bene in certi video. La tastiera non ha a sua volta il tastierino numerico che poi va beh questo a parere mio va in base a se uno lo trova utile o meno.Detto tutti questi dettagli minimi arriva la parte peggiore, il sistema di raffreddamento e la scheda video: ho provato a giocarci durante la prima settimana, e un giorno è capitato di giocarci per 4/5 ore, è normale che il pc si surriscalda e le prestazioni della scheda video diminuiscano… ma da allora la scheda non ha più funzionato, qualsiasi gioco andava lento (parliamo di 30 fps) eppure il pc non era sotto sforzo. Mi sembra scontato che il pc l’abbia poi rimandato indietro. In tutto ciò il processore, per quello che si paga ci si aspetterebbe un po di più, purtroppo ha solo 4 core. Invito a cercare pc più prestanti e a non prendere pc dal design ultra sottili se si deve rinunciare alle prestazioni.

Es una maravilla de laptop, estilo minimalista, excelente material de construcción, los altavoces suenan muy bien y el brillo de la pantalla supera a varias de la competencia. La mayoría de los juegos correrán en gráficos altos sin ningún problema, no se arrepentirán
